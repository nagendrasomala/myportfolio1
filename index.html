<p> C is a programming language developed at AT & T's Bell laboratories of USA in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie.<br> C become popular because it is simple and easy to use. 
An opinion that is often heard today is- "C has been alredy supreseded by languages like C++,C# and java,so why bother to learn C today".<br>I seriously beg to differ with this opinion.There are several reasons for this.
